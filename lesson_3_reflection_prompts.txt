When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If I want to collaborate with myself or if I want to work from more than one places, I could keep all my work in a remote repository for the convenience it provides.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I coordinate with others, we may have some conflicts and it would be not very convenient to have automatic pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is to be used online (on github) to "copy" one repo to another one.
Clone is to be used (mostly) from remote (such as github) to local to "copy" one repo to local.
Branch is to be used at local to do some work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

This could could save some troubles in merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
