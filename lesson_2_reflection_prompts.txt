What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Some new directories were created by git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from working directory in the sense that it is

the files of interest are put into the staging area (at least for the inital
stage).
The staging area is different from repository in the sense that it is before the
commit and it is only for the file that is changed (or added).
I think it offers an intermediate step for the users to see what kind of change
is planned to be committed to the respository.
